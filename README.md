# My personal library

This is an example repository for CAS DMIT 2023. Feel free to experiment -- you won't break anything.

## Files

- `data/library.json`: Books that I already have in my library.
- `data/recommendations.json`: Books that other people think I should read.

## Task

Add your favorite book to `recommendations.json` and find the errors in `library.json`.

1. Log in to GitHub.
1. Fork this repository.
1. In your forked repository, edit the files `recommendations.json` and `library.json`.
1. Create a pull request from your branch into the `main` branch of the original repository.

**NOTE:** Although you do not have permission to edit the file in the original repository directly, you can still click the *Edit* button on a file in the original repository. GitHub will then automatically fork the repository, let you edit the file in the fork, and propose creating a pull request.

## Other options for editing files

- You can clone the repository on your local machine and open the files using your favorite text editor.
- *Secret trick:* Open the repository's page on GitHub and press <kbd>.</kbd> (the "dot" key on your keyboard). This will open a VS Code instance in your browser, where you can edit the files and also create pull requests.
